by using WITH we can cretae a temp table which can be used only inside that query. 
but if we use view it will create a virtual table/db object which we can use in other queries as well.
syntax:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

example:
-->CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
--> SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];
