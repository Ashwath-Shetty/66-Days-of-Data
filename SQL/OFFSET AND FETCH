offset and fetch will be used only with order by
you can't use fetch without offset.

ORDER BY column_list [ASC |DESC]
OFFSET offset_row_count {ROW | ROWS}
FETCH {FIRST | NEXT} fetch_row_count {ROW | ROWS} ONLY

he OFFSET clause is mandatory while the FETCH clause is optional. Also, the FIRST and NEXT are synonyms respectively so you can use them interchangeably. 
Similarly, you can use the FIRST and NEXT interchangeably.

SELECT
    product_name,
    list_price
FROM
    production.products
ORDER BY
    list_price,
    product_name 
OFFSET 10 ROWS 
FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;
