We saw that the mean can be intuitively understood as the "balance point" of a distribution.
We learned to distinguish conceptually between the sample and the population mean, and we saw that we use different notation for each case.
We demonstrated with a few examples that the sample mean 
¯
x
 is an unbiased estimator for the population mean 
μ
.

increase the sample size to get less population and sample mean variablity or less sampling error.
sampling error=mean(population)-mean(sample)
