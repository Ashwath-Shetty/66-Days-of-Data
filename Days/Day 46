dataquest->stats->sampling
3. cluster sampling.
slide 10
- This scenario is quite common in the data science workflow: you want to answer some questions about a population, 
but the data is scattered in such a way that data collection is either time-consuming or close to impossible. 
For instance, let's say you want to analyze how people review and rate movies as a function of movie budget. There are many websites that can help with data collection,
but how can you go about it so that you can spend a day or two on getting the data you need, rather than a month or two?

- One way is to list all the data sources you can find, and then randomly pick only a few of them from which to collect. 
Then you can individually sample each of the sources you've randomly picked. We call this sampling method cluster sampling, 
and we call each of the individual data sources a cluster.

chapter 2: dataquest->stats->variables
The properties with varying values we call variables. The height property in our dataset is an example of a variable. 
In fact, all the properties described in our dataset are variables.
2 types of variables:

  1. quantitative variable-> quantity-> age, height etc.-> basically numerical variables
  2. qualitative variables-> categories-> name, school etc.

Scales of measurement:
1. Nominal Scale:
The Team variable is an example of a variable measured on a nominal scale. For any variable measured on a nominal scale:
We can tell whether two individuals are different or not (with respect to that variable).
We can't say anything about the direction and the size of the difference.
We know that it can only describe qualities.
2. Ordinal Scale:
Generally, for any variable measured on an ordinal scale, we can tell whether individuals are different or not, we can also tell the direction of the difference, 
but we still can't determine the size of the difference.
