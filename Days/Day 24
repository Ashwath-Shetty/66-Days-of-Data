log loss
Log Loss = - 1.0 * ( target * log(prediction) + (1 - target) * log(1 - prediction))
For multiple samples in the dataset, the log-loss over all samples is a mere average 
of all individual log losses. One thing to remember is that log loss penalizes quite 
high for an incorrect or a far-off prediction, i.e. log loss punishes you for being very 
sure and very wrong

multi-class classification
- Macro averaged precision: calculate precision for all classes individually 
and then average them
- Micro averaged precision: calculate class wise true positive and false 
positive and then use that to calculate overall precision
- Weighted precision: same as macro but in this case, it is weighted average 
depending on the number of items in each class.
