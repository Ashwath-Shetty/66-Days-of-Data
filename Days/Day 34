- target encoder
  - for target encoder, do target encoding in every fold for train and valid.
  - if you do encoding for full train and test, before k-fold validation,that will result in overfitting.
  
- we can smoothing to regularize/penalize the target encoder otherwise it might overfitt.
need to study smoothing better.
