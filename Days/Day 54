data quest-> intermediate stats -> mean
1. mean
2. weighted mean
3. median
4. when to use mean and median
- for ordinal go with the median is preferable.
- outliers affect mean but not median.
- mean helps to see the change in distribution, a small change will also contribute to the mean since it takes all the values equally important.
