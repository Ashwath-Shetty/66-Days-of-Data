Approaching categorical variables from book
Nominal variables are variables that have two or more categories which do not 
have any kind of order associated with them. For example, if gender is classified 
into two groups, i.e. male and female, it can be considered as a nominal variable.
Ordinal variables, on the other hand, have “levels” or categories with a particular 
order associated with them. For example, an ordinal categorical variable can be a 
feature with three different levels: low, medium and high. Order is important.
As far as definitions are concerned, we can also categorize categorical variables as 
binary, i.e., a categorical variable with only two categories. Some even talk about 
a type called “cyclic” for categorical variables. Cyclic variables are present in 
“cycles” for example, days in a week: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday. After Saturday, we have Sunday again. This is a 
cycle. Another example would be hours in a day if we consider them to be 
categories
