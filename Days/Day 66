dataquest-> stats -> probabilities -> estimating probabilities.

Generally, the probability of an event (a coin landing heads up, getting a 5 when we roll a die, etc.) 
approaches the true probability value as the number of trials of the random experiment (a coin toss, the rolling of a die, etc.) increases without bound.
