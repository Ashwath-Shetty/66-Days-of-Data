2. Chapter 2: Supervised and unsupervised ML.
Supervised ML:
what is supervised ML?
data always has one or multiple targets associated with it

Classification and Regression.
Classification: predicting a category, e.g. dog or cat.
Regression: predicting a value, e.g. house prices

Unsupervised ML:
what is unsupervised ML?
Unsupervised datasets do not have a target associated with them

types of techniques to use- clustering, PCA, t-SNE.

things to work more on:
-types of unsupervised learning techniques in detail.
-evaluation of unsupervised learning models.
-semi supervised learning with an example.
