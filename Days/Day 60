dataquest -> intermediate stats -> z scores
- Z score is nothing but figuring out a value is how much standard deviation away from the mean of the population / sample.
- z= (any value x - mean of pop) / SD
-  z score can be both positive and negative.
- We can see that a z-score has two parts:
    - The sign, which indicates whether the value is above or below the mean.
    - The value, which indicates the number of standard deviations that a value is away from the mean.
