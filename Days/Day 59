dataquest -> intermediate stats -> measure of variability
- mean squared distances / mean squared deviation / variance= sum of squares of distances between the points / total number of points
- standard deviation=sqrt(variance)
  - larger the sd more spread the data is.
  - sqrt( (x-sample_mean)**2/n )
  where n is the sample size.
  for population replace n with N and sample mean with pop mean.
  
- SD for sampling
  - ususally sample sd < population sd because it's highly likely that population will have a larger spread and sample will have a smaller spread.
  - Getting a sample with a higher standard deviation than in the population is possible, but this is less likely. 
  This is mostly specific to samples with a high spread and no clusters.
  - inorder to solve the underestimation of samples problem, we decrease the n value by 1 in formula -> n-1
  sqrt( (x-sample_mean)**2/n-1 )
  this small correction we have done is called 'bessel's correction'.
  
- unbiased estimator - mean, variance if we do sampling with replacement.
- S.D is not an unbiased estimator.
