1. stratified sampling
- proportionate stratified sampling.
 it maintains the proportion that population has in samples.
 for e.x: 20% male and 70% female in population then, sample will also have the same proportion.
- Disproportionate sampling 
  where the sample size of each stratum is equal irrespective of the population size of the stratum

Here are a few guidelines for choosing good strata:

1. Minimize the variability within each stratum.

For instance, avoid having in the same stratum a player that has scored 10 points and a player that has scored 500. If the variability is high, it might be a sign that you either need more granular stratification (you need more strata), or you need to change the criterion of stratification (an example of criterion is minutes played).

2. Maximize the variability between strata.

Good strata are different from one another. If you have strata that are similar to one another with respect to what you want to measure, you might need a more granular stratification, or you might need to change the stratification criterion. On the previous screen, stratifying the data by games played resulted in strata that were similar to each other regarding the distribution of the total points. We managed to increase the variability between strata by changing the criterion of stratification to minutes played.

3. The stratification criterion should correlate strongly with the property you're trying to measure.

For instance, the column describing minutes played (the criterion) should be correlate strongly with the number of total points (property we want to measure).
