Sampling
1. Simple Random Sampling
- Simple random sampling isn't a reliable sampling method when the sample size is small. 
   Because sample means vary a lot around the population mean, there's a good chance we'll get an unrepresentative sample.
- When we do simple random sampling, we should try to get a sample that is as large as possible. 
  A large sample decreases the variability of the sampling process, which, in turn, decreases the chances that we'll get an unrepresentative sample.
cons:
   it's not guaranteed that we'll have a representative sample that has observations for every position we want to analyze.

2. Stratified Sampling
 - Because simple random sampling is entirely random, it can exclude certain population individuals who are relevant to some of our questions.
 - To ensure we end up with a sample that has observations for all the categories of interest, we can change the sampling method. 
   We can organize our data set into different groups and then do simple random sampling for every group. 
   We can group our data set by player position, and then sample randomly from each group.
