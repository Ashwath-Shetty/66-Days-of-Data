dataquest-> stats-> frequency distributions.
  - freq dist is just value counts.
  - Because proportions and percentages are relative to the total number of instances in some set of data, they are called relative frequencies. 
  In contrast, the frequencies we've been working with so far are called absolute frequencies because they are absolute counts and don't relate to the total number of instances.
