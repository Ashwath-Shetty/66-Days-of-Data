dataquest->intermediate stats-> mode
unimodal -> one mode
bimodal -> 2 modes.
multimodal -> more than 2 modes.
no mode is also possible -> e.x continuous data -> sales price.
 -Left-skewed distributions: the mode is on the far right, the median is to the left of themode, and the mean is to the left of the median.
 - Right-skewed distributions: the mode is on the far left, the median is to the right of themode, and the mean is to the right of the median.
 - Normal distributions: the mean, the median, and the mode are all in the center of thedistribution
 - Uniform distributions: the mean and the median are at the center, and there's no mode.
 - Any symmetrical distribution: the mean and the median are at the center, while theposition of the mode may vary, and there can also be symmetrical distributions havingmore than one mode.
