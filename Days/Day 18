Abhishe thakur's book 4th chapter evaluation metrics
read about accuracy, precision, recall.
True positive (TP): Given an image, if your model predicts the image has 
pneumothorax, and the actual target for that image has pneumothorax, it is 
considered a true positive.
True negative (TN): Given an image, if your model predicts that the image does not 
have pneumothorax and the actual target says that it is a non-pneumothorax image, 
it is considered a true negative.
In simple words, if your model correctly predicts positive class, it is true positive, 
and if your model accurately predicts negative class, it is a true negative.
False positive (FP): Given an image, if your model predicts pneumothorax and the 
actual target for that image is non- pneumothorax, it a false positive.

False negative (FN): Given an image, if your model predicts non-pneumothorax 
and the actual target for that image is pneumothorax, it is a false negative.
In simple words, if your model incorrectly (or falsely) predicts positive class, it is 
a false positive. If your model incorrectly (or falsely) predicts negative class, it is a 
false negative

Accuracy Score = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Let’s say we make a new model on the new skewed dataset and our model correctly 
identified 80 non-pneumothorax out of 90 and 8 pneumothorax out of 10. Thus, we 
identify 88 images out of 100 successfully. The accuracy is, therefore, 0.88 or 88%.

But, out of these 100 samples, 10 non-pneumothorax images are misclassified as 
having pneumothorax and 2 pneumothorax are misclassified as not having 
pneumothorax.
Thus, we have:
- TP : 8
- TN: 80
- FP: 10
- FN: 2
So, our precision is 8 / (8 + 10) = 0.444. This means our model is correct 44.4% 
times when it’s trying to identify positive samples (pneumothorax).

But, out of these 100 samples, 10 non-pneumothorax images are misclassified as 
having pneumothorax and 2 pneumothorax are misclassified as not having 
pneumothorax.
Thus, we have:
- TP : 8
- TN: 80
- FP: 10
- FN: 2
So, our precision is 8 / (8 + 10) = 0.444. This means our model is correct 44.4% 
times when it’s trying to identify positive samples (pneumothorax).
